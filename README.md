## A Drum Machine

This project is part of freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects.

In this project, I used jQuery and Bootstrap.

In order to get all fcc tests to pass, I couldn't do this project the way I wanted.  
So I made [another version](https://github.com/jvitoralb/Gwen-QuotesMach) of this project.
